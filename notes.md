## Two Students Failed To Show Mastery Of Functions And Control Flow

- Carl and Jessica had 1s for both concepts
- considering these two concepts' similarities, this would be an opportunity to provide some support for them... perhaps a smaller project focused on these concepts

## Some Students Failed To Show Competence With Data Structures

- Carl and Desmonda had 0s across the board for string/arrays/objects
- Would recommend they get extra support with the concept of data structures

## User Story 3 was the most challenging for students

The students who struggled with data structures and control flow usually struggled with this one

## Students Excelled On Git Workflows

- 35 students total, 33 2s and 2 1s
- That's:
  - 94% mastery
  - 6% competence
  - 0% failed to show competence
- Since this tool is a workflow, while it's important, if students are using it correctly--and they are--then we're right where we should be
- Thus the recommendation is not to stretch their skills on this until later in the curriculum
- In other words: their mastery over this is not a sign that we are failing to push them far enough out of their comfort zone and into the learning zone
- Just a sign that we're preparing them well for this

## Some students struggled with arrays despite string mastery

- Jessica, Abel, and Caroline showed mastery of strings but failed to show competence with arrays.
- Would recommend the connections between these two concepts be made clearer to them
- Possible room for improvement to the curriculum--draw a clearer line between these two data structures, as they are similar enough that there should be little discrepancy between mastery of the two

## Quick action item: there was an identifiable error in a score

Myra got beyond the top score on User Story 3, which should not be possible. Another grader should take a quick look at this user story grade and adjust accordingly.
