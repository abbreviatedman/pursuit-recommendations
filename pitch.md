## An Analysis of student progress in project 1

#### by Colin Jaffe

With recommendations for these students and the curriculum in general.

---

### Students Excelled On Git Workflows

#### Should this concept be more advanced at this point?

Out of 35 students total:

- 94% **mastery**
- 6% **developing**
- 0% **failed** to show basic competence

The **recommendation** is **_not_** to stretch their skills on this until **later** in the curriculum.

## Since this is a code-adjacent **workflow** **tool**, if students are using it correctly--and they are--then we're **_right where we should be_**.

### User Story 3 was the most challenging for students

6 students struggled with this one (**Carl**, **Desmonda**, **Jessica**, **Jukay**, **Corey**, and **Jimmy**).

**_Recommendations_**:

1. A smaller, User-Story-3-like project, or a revisiting of these concepts **generally** and of User Story 3 **specifically**.
2. An **action** **plan** outlining what concepts they need to be confident on moving forward, with **resources** and **specific** **action** **items** they can take.

### Three Students Failed To Show Mastery Of an Entire major Area

- **Carl** and **Desmonda** had 0s across the board for **data structures** (string, arrays, and objects).
- **Carl** and **Jessica** had 1s for **macro-level logical concepts** (functions and control flow).

**_Recommendation_**:

Small-group tutoring on these concepts.

---

### A discrepancy between array and string mastery

- Jessica, Abel, and Caroline showed **mastery** of **strings** despite **failing** to show basic competence with **arrays**.
- **_Student Recommendation_**: the **connections** between these two concepts be made **clearer** to these students.
- **_Curriculum Recommendation_**: draw a **clearer** **line** between these two similar data structures--there should be **little** **discrepancy** in mastery of the two.

### Conclusion

**Very strong performance** overall, with some concrete areas for improvement. A **big success** for this cohort!
